**Author:** Anna Światłowska

---

## Abstract
The subject of this dissertation is the visual identity system of the Museum of Warsaw, along with the typographic system of exhibitions created on its basis, the design of the infographic exhibition "Warsaw Data" and the publication accompanying this exhibition. The design activities described here constituted an important stage of work on building the brand of the Museum of Warsaw and on organizing, systematizing, and improving its visual communication. They can therefore serve as a point of reference for broader considerations of graphic design for museums, or as a basis for formulating more general conclusions and recommendations.
